This is the code for my <a href="https://ratsinmyoffice.org">website</a>. I don't feel like paying for a web hosting service so I went with Github Pages, which is why this repo's public.
<br>
Don't expect anything crazy. All I'm doing rn is writing down ARG guides. If you got a ARG you want me to check out or there's an issue on the website put it on issues or idk.

## To-do List
~~Revise BW pages~~<br>
Create favicon image<br>
~~Might have to create a script for href stuffs~~<br>
Finish Gloam, Silent Hill, and FSI pages<br>
Add page quotations to SH (if allowed)<br>
