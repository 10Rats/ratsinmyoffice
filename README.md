This is the code for my <a href="https://ratsinmyoffice.org">website</a>. I don't feel like paying for a web hosting service so I went with Github Pages, which is why this repo's public.
<br>
Don't expect anything crazy. All I'm doing rn is writing down ARG guides. If you got a ARG you want me to check out put it on issues or idk.

## To-do List
<ul>
  <li>Revise BW pages</li>
  <li>Create favicon image</li>
  <li>Might have to create a script for href stuffs</li>
  <li>Finish Gloam, Silent Hill, and FSI pages</li>
</ul>
