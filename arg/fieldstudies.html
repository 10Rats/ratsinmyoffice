<p>First appeared at around 2024, Field Studies Institution is a multi-medium project developed by <a href="https://www.immersivefiction.com/" target="_blank">Immersive Fiction</a>. This ARG centers around a fictional organization dedicated to gathering transient objects and studying their properties.</p>

<h2>What</h2>
<i>Object/Concept/Organization</i>
<div>
<h3>LBA-01 (Large Bright Anomaly)</h3>
<p>An extraterrestrial object that landed on Earth's moon. Later discovered in 1967 when the unmanned Surveryor 3 landed on the lunar surface. Was last seen being studied by Project SOMA.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
<h3>Transient Objects</h3>
<p>First appeared in local spacetime's 1970, transient objects originate from Deviation Omega (Will refer it to as "Omega" here). They're often mundane items such as a coffee mug or a book, but may contain information that doesn't line up with the local timeline events. Not all transient objects are tangible, as all the "extraction" tapes are actually datas from Omega transported to local timeline.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
<h3>Spacetime Deviations</h3>
<p>Also known as alternate universes, some deviations are naturally occuring while a few are artificially made. Arthur Reese once suggested the use of wormholes to travel to different universes, but notes that anyone entering a wormhole will experience immense gravitational pull and time dilation. There has been at least three confirmed cases where someone has successfully arrived at another spacetime: CLAUDE, Reese, and Halley.</p>
<br>
<p>Some interesting details on the three cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>They lost most of their memories, but are able to remember their names</li>
<li>Given enough time, they're able to recover their memories</li>
<li>All three were transported to Omega within different time periods.</li>
<ul>
<li>CLAUDE appeared in 1972</li>
<li>Reese appeared in 1986</li>
<li>Halley appeared in 1999</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</div>
<br>
<div>
<h3>Deviation Omega</h3>
<p>An artificial spacetime created right after three members from Project SOMA disappeared. A timeline of Omega can be found in this <a href="#when">section</a>.</p>
<br>
<p>CLAUDE hints that Omega is a flawed copy of a spacetime. What kind of "error" Omega has isn't specified.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
<h3>Field Studies Institute</h3>
<p>Formed after the New Year's Eve incident, FSI's goal is to gather and study transient objects that are appearing around the world. They're currently stationed in Merritt Island, Florida. There are at least ten departments within the organization:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>C-Suite: Unknown</li>
<li>Research &amp; Development: Unknown</li>
<li>Archives: Responsible with the archival of internal records and transient objects</li>
<li>Physics Lab: Unknown</li>
<li>Division X: Unknown</li>
<li>Partnerships: Unknown</li>
<li>Temporal Lab: Responsible for constructing the timeline of Omega and often works with other departments such as field and archives.</li>
<li>Field: Responsible with retrieving transient objects</li>
<li>Human Resources: Unknown</li>
<li>Maintenance: Unknown</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><a href="https://fieldstudiesinstitute.org/databank/obj_archive/shadow_on_a_mountain_top/" target="_blank">shadow_on_a_mountain_top</a> hints that FSI is continuing SOMA's research on creating deviations, but their current progress on it hasn't been revealed yet.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
<h3>Project SOMA</h3>
<p>Created as part of Department of Defense's effort to research LBA-01 and deviations.</p>
<br>
<p>The team consisted of eight members: Arthur Reese, Alice Fiorella, Amelia Haydock, Mathilda Remlinger, Dorothy Ross, Carlos Scharf, Todd Tilzer, and Alan Trenchard.</p>
<br>
<p>During New Year's Eve, Reese, Ross, and Trenchard went missing. Afterwards, SOMA was disbanded and the remaining members founded Field Studies Institute.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
<h3>Trenchard-Ross Computer Systems</h3>
<p>Omega-based company that was founded since ~1972. It was named after Alan Trenchard and Dorothy Ross (Possibly a reference to Hewlett-Packard?). They had previously purchased a land five miles north of Ovando.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
<h3>IOSET</h3>
<p>Also known as the International Organization of Space Exploration and Technology, IOSET was created before 1986 to represent multiple nations within the space exploration/technology field. It held approximately 77 facilities across the United States.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
<h3>Audiodrome</h3>
<p>Name of the BBS that Randy Ward frequently visited.</p>
</div>
</div>
<br>
<div id="when">

<i>Timelines and/or Major Events</i>
<div>
<h3>Timelines</h3>
<p>Instruction: You can toggle between local and Omega timeline with the switch</p><br>

<br>
<div>
<h3>New Year's Eve</h3>
<p>Towards the end of 1969, three members of Project SOMA team disappeared after using the "object" capable of travelling between different deviations.</p>
<br>
<p>Although Reese is currently in Omega, Ross and Trenchard's whereabouts are unknown.</p>

<div>
<h3>The Garden</h3>
<p>Refers to numerous areas found on Earth, some of which can be found in the Supersonic Territory (now known as Exclusion Zones), Ovando, and Mt. Minsi. Within these zones exhibit unusual phenomenons, such as the ones described by Dr. Boswell.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
<h3>The Exclusion Zones</h3>
<p>Formerly known as the Supersonic Territory, Exclusion zones were created after the rapid decline of public interest towards space-related projects. The zone is monitored by Wirewalkers to keep out trespassers.</p>
