<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>First appeared at around 2024, Field Studies Institution is a multi-medium project created by <a href="https://www.immersivefiction.com/" target="_blank">Immersive Fiction</a>. This ARG centers around a fictional organization dedicated to gathering transient objects and studying their properties.</p>

<h2>What</h2>
<i>Objects and/or Concepts</i>
<div>
<h3>Transient Objects</h3>
<p>First appeared in local spacetime's 1970, transient objects originate from Deviation Omega (Referred to as "Omega" here). They're often mundane items such as a coffee mug or a book, but may contain information that doesn't line up with the local timeline. Not all transient objects are tangible, as all the "extraction" tapes are actually datas from Omega transported to local timeline.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
<h3>Spacetime Deviations</h3>
<p>Also known as alternate universes, some deviations are naturally occuring while a few are artificially made. Arthur Reese once suggested the use of wormholes to travel to different universes, but notes that anyone entering a wormhole will experience immense gravitational pull and time dilation. There has been at least three confirmed cases where someone has successfully arrived at another spacetime: CLAUDE, Reese, and Halley.</p>
<br>
<p>Some interesting details on the three cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>They lost most of their memories, but are able to remember their names</li>
<li>Given enough time, they're able to recover their memories</li>
<li>All three were transported to Omega within different time periods.</li>
<ul>
<li>CLAUDE appeared in 1972</li>
<li>Reese appeared in 1986</li>
<li>Halley appeared in 1999</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h3>Timelines</h3>
<p>Instruction: You can toggle between local and Omega timeline with the switch</p><br>

<h2>Where</h2>
<i>Organizations, Factions, and Locations</i>
<div>
<h3>Field Studies Institute</h3>
<p>Formed after the New Year's Eve incident, FSI's goals are to gather and study transient objects that are appearing around the world. They're currently stationed in Merritt Island, Florida. There are at least ten departments within the organization.</p>
<ul>
<li>C-Suite: Unknown</li>
<li>Research &amp; Development: Unknown</li>
<li>Archives: Responsible with the archival of internal records and transient objects</li>
<li>Physics Lab: Unknown</li>
<li>Division X: Unknown</li>
<li>Partnerships: Unknown</li>
<li>Temporal Lab: Responsible for constructing the timeline of Omega and often works with other departments such as field and archives</li>
<li>Field: Responsible with retrieving transient objects</li>
<li>Human Resources: Unknown</li>
<li>Maintenance: Unknown</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br>
<div>
<h3>Project SOMA</h3>
<p>Consisted of eight members: Arthur Reese, Alice Fiorella, Amelia Haydock, Mathilda Remlinger, Dorothy Ross, Carlos Scharf, Todd Tilzer, and Alan Trenchard. Conducted experiments with LBA-01 to create short-term deviations using mayflys.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
<h3>Trenchard-Ross Computer Systems</h3>
<p>Omega-based company that was founded since ~1972. It was named after Alan Trenchard and Dorothy Ross (Possibly a reference to Hewlett-Packard?). They had previously purchased a land five miles north of Ovando.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
<h3>IOSET</h3>
<p>Also known as the International Organization of Space Exploration and Technology, IOSET was created before 1986 to represent multiple nations within the space exploration/technology field. It held approximately 77 facilities across the United States.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
<h3>Audiodrome</h3>
<p>Name of the BBS that Randy Ward frequently visited.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
<h3>The Garden</h3>
<p>Refers to multiple zones across the globe, some of which can be found in the Supersonic Territory (now known as Exclusion Zones), Ovando, and Mt. Minsi. Within these zones exhibit unusual phenomenons, such as the ones described by Dr. Boswell.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
<h3>The Exclusion Zones</h3>
<p>Formerly known as the Supersonic Territory, Exclusion zones were created after the rapid decline of public interest towards space-related projects. The zone is monitored by Wirewalkers to keep out trespassers.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
<h3>Map of Interests</h3>
<p>A map has been created to locate any places of interest within FSI's universe. You can view the map <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1dHMjRuIHQSDo7xJ9P79VWEMQ8bqNwa8" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
