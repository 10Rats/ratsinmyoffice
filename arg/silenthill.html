<h1>Lore</h1>
<p>1990s -- Walter Sullivan commited several murders across Silent Hill</p>
<br>
<p>2000s -- Sullivan was eventually arrested, and then commited suicide in his cell</p>
<br>
<details>
<summary>Spoilers</summary>
<br>
<p>2008(?) -- At some point Oliver King's life, he began to admire Walter Sullivan. With that admiration in mind, he moved to Silent Hill to commit a string of murders. He carefully selected his victims based on their first and last name (the name initials of each victims were supposed to spell out "WALTERISHERE"), but accidentally murdered the wrong person (Now spelling out "WALTERISHEMP").</p>
<br>
<p>Oliver King planned on leaving a tourist brochure on his final crime scene, but lost it in the process. You found that very same brochure and decided to keep it.</p>
<br>
<p>2017~2024 -- Felix figured out that William is actually an alias and that he may have a connection to the recent murders. After Felix confronted William about it, he was found dead near an apartment building.</p>
</details>
<br>
<p>Now -- You contacted Ruby about the tourist brochure</p>
<br>
<details>
<summary>Spoilers</summary>
<br>
<p>Now -- William found out that you had the brochure, and used several fake accounts to force you to get rid of it. This failed once Ruby decided to background check each accounts, so William decided to find and murder both you and Ruby. You successfully deleted your personal info off the website's database before William could get to it, preventing your death.</p>
<br>
<p>Both you and Ruby survived and William gets arrested. You later discover that William's actual name is Oliver King. He later confessed his murder of Felix to the police.</p>

<p>To be honest, there's a girl I've been interested in for a while now. I'm planning to confess my feelings to her once this page hits a certain number of views. I'm not sure how many curious people will stumble upon this hidden page, but if you're reading this, I hope you'll cheer me on!</p><br>
<p>As of July 10, 2024... just 10 more views to go. Almost there. I'm so nervous!</p>

<h1>D4-Mail</h1>
<i>D4-Mail is a platform where people can interact with fictional users through a mailing system. The entirety of the D4-Mail plotline must be completed in order to uncover the remaining hidden pages. This page will provide a step-by-step guide on how to complete each chapters.</i>
<br>
<div id="prereq">
<h2>Prerequisite</h2>
<p>To start the D4-Mail storyline, go back to the registration page from <a href="#pg1">#1</a>. Make sure the "Type of artifact" is set to "Tourist brochure". As for the rest of the form, it doesn't matter what info you put in. Check the agreement and submit. You'll be met with a page with a D4-Mail link attached at the bottom.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div id="material">
<h2>Material Code</h2>
<p>Ruby will ask you for the material code of the pamphlet, which can be found on the <a href="https://www.silenthill-historicalsociety.com/collected-data/tourist-spot/pamphlet/" target="_blank">pamphlet page</a> (<mark>MH-391475</mark>). As of September 26, 2024, this code has been stripped away from the pamphlet image. Reply to her email with the code and wait for a response.</p>
<br>
<p>Ruby replies back, asking you to enter your address so she can send you a return envelope. You do not have to enter your actual address on the form.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div id="anon">
<h2>Anonymous Threat</h2>
<p>~24 hours later, a person sends you an email demanding you to destroy the pamphlet for your own safety.</p>
<br>
<p>Couples minutes after reading the email, Detective Walker Clark sends you an email, asking you to not follow any of the instructions from the previous email.</p>
<br>
<p>William lets you know that he'll have a religious expert get in touch with you.</p>
<br>
<p>Donald Brown, the religious expert, asks you to perform a cleansing ritual by getting rid of any pictures of the pamphlet.</p>
<br>
<p>William comes back again, reminding you to perform the ritual and to send the pamphlet as soon as the envelope arrives.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div id="ruby">
<h2>Ruby</h2>
<p>~24 hours after completing the previous chapter, Ruby sends you an email. She asks you to send the email address that belongs to Walker.</p>
<br>
<p>If you reply with the address, she will also ask you for the address that belongs ot Donald. Reply with the address.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div id="william">
<h2>William is Here</h2>
<p>~24 hours after completing the previous step, you'll soon realize that Walker and Donald do not exist, and are fake email addresses managed by William. She wants you to check out a link that was ordered to be deleted by William.</p>
<br>
<p>You'll then get an email from William and threatens you, letting you know that he knows where you are.</p>
<br>
<p>Ruby comes back, asking you to login to the admin page and delete any data before William gets to it. The issue is that Ruby's account is locked, and only Felix's old account remains open. She tells you his ID should follow the same format as Ruby's (RubyS2021), and the password is the name of something he desires the most.</p>
<br>
<p>For the ID, "Ruby" is her first name and "S" is the first letter of her last name. As for "2021", that is the year when she first joined the Silent Hill Historical Society. Following this format, Felix's ID should be "<mark>FelixC2017</mark>". As for the password, the one thing Felix desired the most is "<mark>Ruby</mark>".</p>
<br>
<p>Once you login to the admin page, click on the "Delete data" button and confirm.</p>
<br>
<p>Few minutes later, Ruby will let you know that you successfully deleted all user data from the website.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div id="ray">
<h2>RAY from D4KK</h2>
<p>~48 hours after completing the previous chapter, you'll get two emails. The first email is from Ruby, in which she shares you a Youtube video.</p>
<br>
<p>The second email is from RAY, with a link included in the message. Clicking on the link laeds you to a page locked behind a password.</p>
<br>
<p>The page asks you to enter the "last word" into the password form. The "last word" is actually referring to a phrase in Ruby's final email (<mark>I'm here for the pizza place</mark>). The password is punctuation-sensitive so it's best to copy-paste the phrase off the email.</p>
