<p>The kappa is a yokai or a spirit that can be found by rivers, ponds, and other bodies of water. The size of a child, kappas vary broadly in appearance, but typically have a beak, a turtle shell, and a bowl-shaped indentation on the top of their heads that contains water vital to a kappa's well-being. Kappas have unpredictable temperaments. While some are friendly and mischievous, others are bloodthirsty maniacs with an appetite for human flesh. Kappas are also fond of cucumbers. In the event a kappa tries to drown, tickle, or eat you, they can be warded off with an offering of cucumbers. Go ahead and try it next time you encounter a kappa. If you do not have any cucumbers, you can try tricking the kappa. A common way to trick a kappa is to bow in respect. Kappas typically feel obliged to bow in response, and when they bow, out spills the water. And with it, their powers. However, some modern kappas have become wise to this tactic, and will tear your head clean off your shoulder if you attempt this maneuver. The Gloam Tourism Association recommends that an explorer should always carry at least three cucumbers in their travel kit. Not only can they save your life, they are also high in fiber and vitamin K.</p>

<p>There are many legends in Mundanish culture that involve humans passing through a portal of some sort into another dimension. Dimensional vortexes can take myriad forms, from a toadstool ring, to a rabbithole, to a seemingly commonplace wardrobe. Your dimension is riddled with dimensional vortexes. We understand that you humans might want to step through a portal and travel to a magical dimension, but we highly recommend you don't. Because the thing is, we don't want you to. Please don't human. You should really stay in your dimension, just stick to your violent and corrupt planet Earth, because every time you decide to explore the multiverse, the result is typically tragedy and bloodshed. However, if your murderous inclinations run so deep, you are overwhelmed with the desire to travel dimensionally, you may be in luck.

<div class="quotation">
<p>Scottish born journalist, newspaper publisher, and politician William Lyon McKenzie was elected as the first mayor of Toronto in 1834. And in 1837, he orchestrated the upper Canada rebellion with the aim of establishing a more democratic government and to address rampant political corruption, cronyism, and economic inequality. Mackenzie's activities during the rebellion were somewhat erratic. He punished wealthy families by burning down their homes. He attempted to force the upper Canada postmaster's wife to cook meals for his troops. He robbed mail coaches and kidnapped travelers all for the cause, of course. In 1838, the rebellion was crushed by British troops, and although it failed, it eventually led to reform and the introduction of responsible government. McKenzie lived in exile until he was granted amnesty in 1849 when he returned to Toronto to live in the house before you. He died here in 1861 and his ghost is believed to haunt the dwelling. Many people claim to have seen his apparition, often near the fireplace. Other Paranormal occurrences in Mackenzie house include reports of visitors hearing footsteps on the creaky wooden floors when no one is present, unexplained knocking, tapping and other strange sounds, objects moving on their own, doors opening and closing, as well as sudden drops in temperature at certain areas inside the house. If you gaze up at the window, that one to the left, maybe you'll catch a glimpse of his ghost.</p>

<p>Casa Loma, the house on the hill was designed for wealthy magnate Sir Henry Pellatt by renowned Toronto architect E.J. Lennox as a testament to his vast fortune. The construction cost $3.5 million, equivalent to $80 million today, and took 300 workers and 3 years to build. The castle had many interesting features, such as an oven large enough to roast an ox and several secret passages like the one that leads to the stables, which house the top secret weapons laboratory during the Second World War. Pellatt's fortune was fleeting, as his ostentatious display of wealth raised public ire and had political ramifications. His property taxes were increased 2000% and his private ownership of Toronto's electric utility, which was the basis for much of his wealth, was taken over by the province of Ontario. Pellatt faced further losses in land speculation and he and his wife, Lady Mary, were forced to vacate the premises in 1923 when the city seized the castle for unpaid taxes. But perhaps Pellatt never really left, returning after his death to watch over his estate. Rumors have it that he haunts the halls, cutting a ghostly but regal figure. Others have said a lady in white, perhaps Lady Mary, can be seen in her old chambers. Her invisible hands clutch shoulders and sudden chills may pass you over.</p>

<div class="quotation">
<p>The Don Jail is perhaps the most haunted building in Toronto, as it was the site of dozens of executions, suicides, and murders. When it first opened in 1864, it was considered a palace for prisoners. When it closed down in 2013, almost a 150 years later, it had fallen into such a wretched state that persons serving time in the Don were credited with 3 days against their sentence for each day spent in the facility. In 2003, the Toronto Star reported that the jail reeked of urine and vomit, and entering it was like walking into a madhouse from another century. To make matters worse for inmates, the Don is also haunted. Executions at the Don began in 1908, with the hanging of John Boyd, who was executed for murdering a rival suitor. Twenty-six men were executed at the Don before Canada's last two hangings took place here in 1962. The most famous ghost to haunt the Don died from hanging. But in her case, it was not an execution, but a suicide. The Lady of the Don is the ghost of a woman who hung herself in a tiny cell in the west wing using her bed sheets. An angry and disturbing apparition, the lady wanders the west wing and the rotunda. Forever trapped in time, her blonde hair and white dress, billowing in a chill Phantom wind.</p>

<div class="quotation">
<p>Born in Scotland in 1829, William Christie built a baking fortune and became a prominent member of Toronto's society before passing away from cancer in 1900. Christie Street in the West End is named after him, and his original cookie factory still stands as part of the George Brown Campus. The mansion he built in the exclusive Queen's Park Neighborhood was left to his son, Robert, whose demented perversions led it to becoming one of Toronto's most notorious haunted buildings. Robert arranged to have a secret chamber built in the mansion to house his mistress, who lived in the building right under the noses of his unwitting wife and children. He had his servants court an office section of the property, dubbed "Room 29", for his mistress, who became like a prisoner stuck in this room night and day, unable to roam freely, only finding company when provided with food or a visit from the libidinous Robert. Over time, these visits became less frequent as Robert grew tired of his aging mistress, leaving the poor woman isolated and alone. When it finally became too much to bear, she hung herself from the rafters with a bed sheet to be discovered by the servants. Robert, fearing shame and investigation, had her body removed and buried on the grounds of Queen's Park where she remains to this day without the dignity of a headstone. It is said that her ghost still haunts the notorious Room 29 and if you enter by yourself at night, the door will swing shut behind you, locking itself and trapping you inside, just like the unnamed woman was trapped all those years ago. Mr. Christie, you make good cookies and you also drive poor women to suicide.</p>

<div class="quotation">
<p>Completed in 1899, Old City Hall was designed by Toronto architect E.J. Lennox. The construction took ten years and the equivalent of $53 million in today's money. This upset city councilors, who refused Lennox a plaque proclaiming him the architect. So Lennox had stonemasons carve his name into the building. Look up and you can see "EJ LENNOX ARCHITECT AD 1898" cut into the stonework below the upper eaves. Take that city council! The building is widely considered to be one of Toronto's most haunted, and houses a number of apparitions. The rear staircase is haunted by a poltergeist that enjoys tugging at judges' robes. At night, it walks up and down the stairs, where its echoing footsteps can be heard. If it's dark out, listen closely. Do you hear the footsteps? I do. There were holding cells in the basement of Old City Hall, which once kept prisoners awaiting sentencing. There are many reports of wailing and moaning emanating from these now-empty cells. These cells once held Robert Turpin and Arthur Lucas, the last two men sentenced to hang in Canada. Twenty-nine-year-old Turpin was a small-time thief who shot a policeman while fleeing a restaurant robbery. Fifty-four-year-old Lucas was convicted of killing an FBI informant. Lawyer Ross McKay represented both men and he believed them to be innocent. This would not save them from the hangman's noose. Now, these vengeful spirits are said to haunt court Room 33. A pair of reporters attempted to spend the night in the courtroom one Halloween, but they fled in terror by 4 AM. The reporters told of "cruel fogs" and weird noises that left them at times glued to the floor. We suggest you try spending a night in the courtroom. Do you think you can make it the whole night through? If you do, give us a call, we'll be expecting you.</p>

<p>The satyr is a creature renowned throughout the universe for its ribaldry and hyperactive libido, not unlike creatures from your dimension, such as the Pete Davidson, the Tom Jones, and the Liberace. With the body of a man and the legs of a horse or goat, the satyr parties the night away at the side of the God Dionysus. Typically depicted in a state of permanent arousal, satyrs have no need for viagra, raw oysters, or manish water. Perpetually inebriated, satyrs may seem like good company, but they do not make good dinner party guests. It is wise to have a spray bottle or rolled up newspaper handy to spray or swat the satyr if it starts acting up. Although, due to its nature, a satyr may actually find this form of punishment pleasurable. If you find a satyr in your dimension, it would be best to avoid it, and under no circumstances should you attempt to milk it.

Their alarming appearance and secretive ways make mothmen easy scapegoats for events such as bridge collapses and apartment bombings. People in your dimension don't understand moth people and their unique lifestyle, but that doesn't mean you have the right to kill them. That's why the area you're standing in was designated as a mothman sanctuary by the Gloam Tourism Association. There are dozens of moth people around you right now, and they don't want to be there. Trust me, no moth in their right mind would want to go to your dimension. Okay, maybe your food is all right, but besides that, what do you have to offer?

<p>Automodations. In your dimension, houses aren't able to stand up, walk around, play games, and make mischief. Although there are many cases of houses achieving sentience, whether through possession, ritual, or by accident, typically, these houses are labeled as haunted and are avoided by humans. Although generally, they are just confused and lonely, and could use a hug. In the Gloam, sentient buildings are known as automodations, and can be found strolling through the fields and meadows, with nary a care in the world, save for fire, lightning, and termite attacks. Automodations are easy to befriend, and have a fondness for sap, syrup, and fresh coats of paint. Once you have bonded with an automodation, they will be your friend for life. If you have fully gained their trust, they may even let you live inside them. With the alignment approaching and the walls between the dimensions blurring, many automodations have stumbled into your world. Lost and alone, they will try to blend in with their surroundings. The next time you see a sad-looking house that seems out of place, you might want to talk to it or give it an offering of sap. Pour the sap around the base of the house, which is where an automodation's feed stalks are located. Who knows? For the cost of a few gallons of sap, you may make a new friend.</p>

<p>Frogs are not as frightening as they would have you believe. Most frogs aren't poisonous, and they rarely kill humans unless they have nothing better to do. Frogs are fond of conversation and are known for being ticklish. Frogs don't like being juggled, nor do they like coffee. What is the perfect frog? Can you picture it? Have you ever kissed a frog? If a frog asked you to kiss it, would you? Why don't you call or text someone you haven't spoken with in a long time, and ask them how they feel about frogs?
