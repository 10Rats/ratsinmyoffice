<h1>Looking Back</h1>
<p>February 12, 2025</p>
<p>Randy's pretty much a dead fossil and everybody I knew online are either old or dead. I was a college student worrying about my next exam. Now my own child is at college and I retire within the next decade. Hahaha time flies when you're busy.</p>
<p>I'll keep this site up until further notice.</p>
</div>
<div class="article">
<h1>Hi</h1>
<p>February 08, 2025</p>
<p>Oh... I completely forgot about this website. If you're seeing this, hi.</p>
</div>
<div class="article">
<h1>New Look</h1>
<p>July 17, 2009</p>
<p>If you're wondering why this website looks different, it's because I'm planning on getting this site active again. So I took the opportunity to change this place up (including the name). Perhaps I could find anything new on Randy if I have enough time?</p>
</div>
<div class="article">
<h1>New Millennium</h1>
<p>December 31, 1999</p>
<img src="../../assets/jakeweek/firework.gif" width="40%">
<p>You saw the title. See you in the next millennium!</p>
</div>
<div class="article">
<h1>Not Much</h1>
<p>June 12, 1997</p>
<p>Welp. I doubt Randy's coming back. But hey, you never know what could happen in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="article">
<h1>SAVE RANDY</h1>
<p>April 03, 1996</p>
<img src="sdfsdfsdf">
<p>Randy might have a shot at getting a revival! Head to <a href="#">this website</a> to participate in our effort.</p>
</div>
<div class="article">
<h1>Sudden Notice</h1>
<p>January 12, 1995</p>
<p>Randy's second season got canceled after silence for months. I mean... that show wasn't like a 10/10 and not many people watched it so I could see why that happened. But still. I want to see what happens to Randy and Cunningham after that finale.</p>
</div>
<div class="article">
<h1>WTF?</h1>
<p>April 18, 1994</p>
<p>What was Cunningham thinking about in the ending? I feel like he's gonna be a full-on accomplice in the next season.</p>
</div>
<div class="article">
<h1>College</h1>
<p>April 09, 1994</p>
<p>Asked some students on campus to see how popular Randy is. I found only one person that has heard of it. To be fair the sample size was super small.</p>
</div>
<div class="article">
<h1>New Episode</h1>
<p>April 05, 1994</p>
<p>"To Err Is Human?"</p>
<p>After what happened to Randy and Ethan outside the diner? Yeah. I don't like what the title's implying...</p>
</div>
<div class="article">
<h1>Thinking About DAMT...</h1>
<p>March 30, 1994</p>
<p>It's pretty obvious that the entire episode was Randy's dream sequence. I can't help but try and come up with my own interpretation of his dream. Here it goes:</p>
<p>Diner: I'm not sure about the diner itself, but I feel like what happened there was supposed to be his urges manifesting in his dreams.</p>
<p>Taxi: I'm theorizing that the driver's Cunningham, since he's acting as a guide in Randy's life.</p>
<p>Party: His dissatisfaction of the party might represent anxiety, or maybe his feeling that he can't fit in with others?</p>
<p>Dead body: Not sure about this one, but that felt pretty significant.</p>
<p>Final scene: Another manifestation of his cannibalistic urges.</p>
<p>This is pretty much why I made this website. So if you're reading this, welcome.</p>
