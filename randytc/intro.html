<h1>Introduction of Randy</h1>
<p><i>Randy has been committing cannibalism for quite some time. He decides to attend a therapy session as an attempt to recover from his addiction.</i> --Official Synopsis</p>

<span><p>Randy (played by Isaac Stonewood) is a cannibal who has stayed under the town's radar for years. He is pretty much your average Joe Shmoe: he works at a typical job and lives in a typical home. He decides to attend therapy with Dr. Cunningham under the guise that he has an alcohol addiction.</p></span>

<img align="left" height="120px" src="empty" width="120px">
<span><p>Cunningham (played by Wayne Thomson) is Randy's therapist. He leans towards the "I need someone to talk with" therapist role, so he sometimes takes the liberty to engage in a deeper conversation with his clients. Towards the end of the last episode, Cunningham discovers that Randy is the Cannibal Killer.</p></span>

<span><p>Altman (played by Mia Dixon) is the detective who recently caught interest in the CK murders after discovering half-eaten remains in a forest. She has done a fair share of murder cases before, but the CK case has proven to be a tough one to crack. Her character would have been more fleshed out as she becomes closer to narrowing down her list of suspects.</p></span>

<span><p>Ethan (played by Christopher Walsh) is a close friend/coworker of Randy. Despite the two being friends and in close contact with each other, their friendship seems... hollow? If you were to look at their conversations, it seems as though a brick wall is talking to another brick wall.</p></span>

<h2>History</h2>
<table width="650">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><i>Randy the Cannibal</i>, created by Shawn McCormick, first aired on Midnight Channel in 1994. This show only aired during late-night, so only a handful of people have watched the show during this period.</p>
<p>Once MC officially announced that RTC's second season was cancelled, people gathered on the web to discuss its cancellation, along with the petition to revive Randy. Unfortunately, as I am writing this (2/12/2000), Midnight Channel has no plans to continue RTC.</p>
<p>While the petition was ongoing, people made dozens of fan pages, fanfics, and factions to show their adoration of the short-lived series. Few years later, without any new RTC content, the fanbase slowly dwindled in population. Many pages became defunct and countless fan-made contents vanished into thin air.</p>
<p>I made this website in hopes that I could preserve what is left of this fandom, even though I probably recovered only a fraction of it. I highly doubt Randy will come back, so I do not expect a sudden surge in population.</p>
