<font size="4">Randy (played by Isaac Stonewood) is a cannibal who has stayed under the town's radar for years. He is pretty much your average Joe Shmoe: he works at a typical job and lives in a typical home. He decides to attend therapy with Dr. Cunningham under the guise that he has an alcohol addiction.</font>

<font size="4">Cunningham (played by Wayne Thomson) is Randy's therapist. He leans towards the "I need someone to talk with" therapist role, so he sometimes takes the liberty to engage in a deeper conversation with his clients. Towards the end of the last episode, Cunningham discovers that Randy is the Cannibal Killer.</font>

<font size="4">Altman (played by Mia Dixon) is the detective who recently caught interest in the CK murders after discovering half-eaten remains in a forest. She has worked on a fair share of murder cases before, but the CK case has proven to be a tough one to crack. Her character would have been more fleshed out as she get closer to narrowing down her list of suspects.</font>

<h2><font size="5">History</font></h2>
<table width="650px">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><font size="4"><i>Randy the Cannibal</i>, created by Shawn McCormick, first aired on Midnight Channel in 1994. This show only aired during late-night, so only a handful of people have watched the show.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Once MC officially announced that RTC's second season was canceled, people gathered on the web to discuss its cancellation, along with the petition to revive Randy. Unfortunately, as I am writing this (2/12/2000), Midnight Channel has no plans to continue RTC.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">While the petition was ongoing, people made dozens of fan pages, fanfics, and factions to show their adoration of the short-lived series. Few years later, without any new RTC content, the fanbase slowly dwindled in population. Many pages became defunct and countless fan-made contents vanished into thin air.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">I made this website in hopes that I could preserve what is left of this fandom, even though I probably recovered only a fraction of it. I highly doubt Randy will come back (for a multitude of reasons), so I do not expect a sudden surge in population.</font></p>
